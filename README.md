# AnyoneCanDoIt
An open source guide to mistake-resistant engineering for plans that don't
require natural talent to do. (Work in progress)


## Intro
A lot of planning these days includes the word "carefully".

What does it mean? Well, it means you don't get distracted and do the wrong thing. Your hands don't shake and you don't forget anything.

In essence, it means "this task requires a high level of skill, possible talents that not everyone can learn, and you're the one who's gotta do it, sucker!".

As everyone who's ever broken anything knows, this is unscientific at best and terrible planning at worst.

Instead of just relying on our own ability, let's think of some ways we can stop these failures before they happen!



This is a fairly extreme set of principles. They likely will not
apply to every situation.

Many are mostly relevant to product design, but they also apply to the selection of existing products.

They are derived from a combination of personal experience, study of mistakes of others, and adaptations
of industry techniques like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_resource_management].

Nonetheless, I believe they may be useful in spotting likely issues with a plan.


## Principles

### Redundancy.

There should not be anywhere in your plan where a single failure can have significant consequences.  One broken rope, one person dropping something, or one lost flashlight shouldn't affect the plan at all.

Two is one and one is none, not just with things, but with actions.  If the plan starts with "It's basically impossible, but I know one guy who can do it by hand for a good price" you might want a different plan.


When adding redundancy, often it is best to use unrelated technologies.

People use candles and lanterns as a backup for a flashlight not because
they are in any way better, but because they are different enough
that they may not be affected by the kind of thing that might cause all your flashlights
to fail at once.

Similarly, when double checking you have all the items packed, you may
choose to count the number of items on the list and in the box, without concerning
yourself with anything but the total number, and then check off each item individually.

This kind of random unrelated strategy may uncover problems not found simply
by repeating the same method twice.

Of course, when one method is very reliable, having two copies
of the gold standard isn't usually a bad thing.



### "Life Experience": Is it really worth it?

While we absolutely shouuld respect, listen to. and learn from the people who have seen and done a lot, I doubt it is any guarantee that they know any particular fact.  Many people will use their general experience to make specific claims without evidence, by saying "I know how the world works, you don't" or similar.

This idea is sometimes used to convince people to put themselves through all kinds of unnecessary torture, by claiming things like "You need to learn how to handle the hard stuff if you're going to succeed.".  This is especially prevalant with sports, with the whole "I learned a lot about life on the gridiron" thing, or the "All those broken bones made them who they are" idea.

In reality, going through a lot of stuff may prove you can survive a bad situation, but it's not going to teach you much about avoiding it in the future, especially if you insist on doing the same thing. Living on the streets for a year is no guarantee you're going to know how to run a Dairy Queen, and in fact, many of the habits people learn in suvival situations actively increase the risk of problems down the road.   Many poor people are incredibly kind, but some are plain evil. It might "Build character"... but what kind of character exactly?

There are heroes who are known the world over for their resolve and toughness.  There are also millions of people who made great
contributions to the world by being careful, looking at the evidence, and avoiding getting themselves into trouble, without ever willingly doing any of these "character building" things we hear so much about.

Clearly, one does not need to get blackout drunk and hung over, tear a ligament at the gym, or backpack across a foreign country alone to accomplish things, and many do all those things, and wind up in quite the sad state anyway.

### Always follow procedure, even when you are absolutely sure you don't need to

There are multiple reasons for this.  One is that your assessment may be wrong,
and by deviating from procedure, you leave yourself open to the consequences of your assessment, whereas
by following it, you can succeeded regardless of the quality of your own judgement

The more important reason is that it is said you will play the way you practice, and
every time you practice doing it wrong, you make it harder to remember to do it right.

You may think you are talented enough to keep it all straight in your head (and even the most
obvious mistakes can be made by the best of us), but what about the people around you?

If you drag others into your deviation from procedure, you make their lives harder.

And if you are the leader, it may well be you that takes the blame for the mistakes they make.


More generally, never drag another person, whatsoever, into your
playing fast and loose, doing things the hard way lifestyle.  When someone
says they can't do something your way, listen to them.

### Nothing to prove

If you don't want to do something, and it doesn't need to be done, there's
no sense wasting thousands of hours to prove you can.

### Nothing to hide

Every secret or lie you tell will likely require maintenance.
Perhaps with more lies, and the tower will eventually collapse.

Not only this, but any slightly bad thing you do can be used as leverage by those far worse than you.

The shady recesses of crooked deals, scams, petty theft, and not-quite-white lies
are simply not worth it.

A stolen item can be found anywhere, by anyone, at anytime.

Not only this, but immoral actions are generally very hard to reverse,
and have completely unpredictable consequences.  You don't know who will be angry,
what they can do, or who will want revenge. 

In every way, and on every level, even the common everyday crimes,
hurtful actions, and lies, are a bad deal.

### Storage and Organization

It's essentially *always* worth the money to buy a case for your phone. If you're gonna buy something that needs an extra adapter, buy one that doesn't if you can.  Use Bluetooth headphones instead of corded ones.

Get a labelmaker. Don't carry anything heavy without a dolly. Use padding to protect anything expensive. Physical objects are a common source of failure, so the accessories we use to manage them, and the upgrades that make them easier to manage, are worth it.

### Force and precision, pick one

Never design anything with the words "Firmly but carefully" in it.  Hands and tools slip under force. If force is needed, you should be able to use a hammer, or you should use a better design.

Stay away from all screws aside from Torx heads. Phillips requires pressing and turning at the same time. No more of that!

Especially avoid anything involving "carefully prying". Nobody wants that.


### Minimum Energy

Don't use dynamite. Or rat poison. Or High voltages, or big strong springs, or giant hydraulics, or anything else with real power behind it, unless you actually need it.

"Safety" should not be the goal. What you want is *harmlessness*.

You don't want a plan that *won't* hurt anyone. You want a plan that *cannot* hurt anyone, because there is no part that has the capability to do so.

If you need a training video to explain how not to hurt yourself, look at eliminating that step entirely.

### Minimum Material

You are trying to make excellent products. Not use up excellent materials.  Every ounce of matter, be it steel or gold, is a waste.

When someone says "Solid gold" they mean "I probably polluted an entire village somewhere because I didn't have any better ideas"

This applies to non-physical "Material" too, like lines of code.  Anything you have to buy, carry, maintain, etc, is a liability.

Go with things that are cheap, common, and inert.


### Don't trust Elegance

Scientists and engineers LOVE simple, short, expressions of some deeper truth, that cuts right to the essence of what it means to be a pencil or a knife or a razor or something.

They also love to wonder why consumer products aren't built like this anymore.   To everyone else, it's obvious.

Non-engineers are trying to sign a check, not marvel at your skill.  The rest of us will be bored long before we ever have a clue why you did what you did.

And more than that, simplicity usually just moves the complexity elsewhere, namely, to the user. It's another word for "manual".

Elegance is a design constraint that doesn't accomplish much.  It results in parts that perform multiple functions at different times, things that loop back on each other so that everything affects every other part, and nobody will have a clue what you're doing.

It's also generally ugly and delicate, because the aesthetic parts, the function parts, and the protective parts are one and the same.  

Many argue that it's just the price of fine craftsmanship, that an old 1800s writing desk was not meant to be set drinks on, but accepting that principle means putting the responsibility back on the people, rather than preventing failure at the design stage.


### No Guessing

You should never have to adjust something you can't immediately see the results of, while you're doing it.  Aside from aesthetics, you mostly shouldn't have anything that needs "adjusting" in the first place.

There shouldn't be too many tweakable parameters you have to get "just right" to make it work.  Those always result in something getting out of calibration over time, and the whole thing goes down for a week while you wait for the guy who knows how to fix it again.

If there is something that needs adjusting (Usually something that directly affects people, like light levels), it should be controlled in real time, with a knob or a slider. No "Reboot and change a config file" or any such nonsese.

In general, things should adjust themselves. Every adjustment the user makes is usually a failure the designer made.

This also applies to pretty much any kind of configuration or setup. Things should just work, and you shouldn't need to tweak them or use a different version for every possible situation.


### Too Many Tools 

Avoid having two similar tools for slightly different applications if you can. They can almost always be merged, unless the task is so large that modifying them takes too much time.

Especially avoid creating a new tool to avoid learning an industry standard that you know you will have to learn anyway.

### No Mental rotation

Just throw the idea in the bin right then and there if it involves accurately imagining something rotated or flipped.  

Things like reading maps not oriented towards the real directions, manually flipping things for printing on two sides of a page, etc, should be treated with extreme care.

### No arbitrary mappings and remappings

If you're plan has something like "Oh yeah A fits into C" or "Just press Ctl-N" or "A is also called 1 in some places", you need to document every step, or avoid the whole plan.  Nobody should have to memorize nonstandard arbitrary codes.


### No Duplicated information or entry

No reporting the same information to different sets of people at different times.  No giving employees multiple ID numbers that apply in different contexts.

No manual bookkeeping that relies on someone updating one document to stay in sync with another.  This should either be automated, one person should be dedicated to this, or the whole plan should be scrapped.

The only time a user should do the same thing twice is as a confirmation. Redundancy should be part of the automated process, not something you do yourself.   

When a confirmation *is* needed, the automated system should immediately check that the data is consistent.

Requiring a user to reliably do the same action more times than needed is not redundancy, it is just multiplying the single points of failure, unless there is tolerance for some of them to be erroneous.

A user should not deal with both the processed and unprocessed version of information.

Avoid anything like common credit card receipts, where one has to write both the tip amount and the total, as the total can be calculated from other information and there is no need for a person to do so.

Most such cases that use the extra manual calculation step as  a confirmation can be replaced by an automatic calculation, and an explicit confirmation prompt.



### Do not be confident, and don't trust someone because they're better than you.

This is neither a football field, nor a chess club, nor a Eugenics festival.

It is not an engineer's job to worship anyone's superior body or brain.

An engineers job is to use careful analysis and the latest tech to achieve results above and beyond the limitations of the body and mind, for the good of all.

Someone who takes great pride in being smarter than you likely does not understand this.

And when it's true, it can be even worse, as they may not even notice how incomprehensible their designs are, causing everyone around them to make mistakes.

### Respect the "blue collar workers"

No matter how long your day was at the office, I am quite sure the team that had to install whatever garbage you're building was far longer.

If they tell you something, believe it.

Sometimes non-technical people have some unscientific ideas and think things are "Too cheap and plasticity" or "not powerful enough" or something, but even then, they probably have at least one legitimate complaint, and ten more they aren't even telling you.

The ones who actually use these systems in real life know a lot more than the ones who design them from behind a desk.

### Use what you have, buy what you need

While helping a friend move, someone once repeatedly tried to convince me to carry various things like couches and bookcases by hand, across level ground, with a perfectly good dolly sitting idle.

Their reasoning? "It's Faster!".

Speed and flexibility is quite often used as a rationale for doing things the hard way.

Unless you enjoy being sore at the end of the day, I see little reason to not use perfectly good existing things, rather than do more work yourself.

Everything you do can fail. Things that happened in the past and already exist are the closest thing to truly predictable we have.


### Don't throw stuff away

Throwing things away is selling them, and being paid in empty space. If you don't need the empty space, you're just wasting things.

### But don't hoard analog junk in the first place

It's heavy, it's delicate, it takes up space, and it only does one thing.

You might want to keep that outfit you wear once a year, but think twice before
you buy that clock radio, corded power drill with a brushed motor, or
other such thing.   Tech always improves, so there's rarely a reason to
mess with the older versions.

Even a desktop computer is questionable if you aren't a hardcore gamer. 
Think light, solid state, digitally controlled, and futureproof.

### Watch the clouds

"Cloud services" are very popular, but they can disappear
at any time, and sometimes cost money constantly, and it doesn't
work without the internet.  As more and more
software becomes cloud oriented, you may want to stat moving away
from such things.

Especially watch out for any physical devices tied to a specific
cloud services.    Voice assistants tend to be from very big companies,
and they probably want to keep selling data, so you might be able to trust that
they will be around a while.

But other things, like smart thermostats, can and have completely dropped support
for old products.

The ideal electronic device for consumers is connected, but in
such a way that it can be controlled locally, without relying
on the manufacturer after you already bought it, but these products
usually take some research to find.

### There is no later

Avoid any plan that involves a person remembering "When X, do Y" or "In 30 minutes, check on the pot".

Especially avoid anything that requires regular recurring maintenance.   

The cheapest plastic may last 500 years, while steel used in the same place may be total rusted when left alone.

Choose plans that are independent of any human action, and especially independent of any *specific* person.


The best way to predict the future is to create it yourself. 
As people's future state cannot be effectively predicted,
 anything dealing with the future should be left to machine.


If you're leaving a pot on the stove to do something else, set a timer
on your phone.   If you need to bring something with you to work tomorrow, 
leave it where it will be impossible to miss while getting ready, and additionally set
a reminder. 

Don't assume you or anyone else will be able to remember something later.

And especially watch out for statements of the form "When X, I will do Y".

I personally usually treat those as a complete impossibility that I am guaranteed to forget,
if the matter is of any importance.


### Tests don't predict the future

Things are not guaranteed to behave as they did in testing in all cases. 

If it works in a test, but theory says it will fail, watch out.

### Avoid hidden state

Hidden state is anything that has a variable condition, such as a door that can be open or closed, but which does not make that state visible, or makes it insufficiently visible.


Appliances that get hot should have power lights.  Just as you shouldn't trust a person to do something later, you shouldn't trust a person to check on something later.

There should not be any "Do X, then check Y" steps. X should obviously and instantly fail if Y is in the wrong state.

Ideally, all things should return to a default safe state if left unattended.


### No Ordering dependancies

Avoid manual processes with steps that must be done in a particular order. This is a common type of error that can be eliminated in the design stage.


### Explicit Not Implicit

Where possible, avoid expecting anyone to manually determine unknown information, even when it is fully specific by present information.

Examples include inches to feet conversion, or manually finding the center of a marked circle to drill a hole.

### Watch for highly transported objects

An objects is unlikely to be lost if it stays in one place.  When a cheap object such as a pen or pair of scissors is used in two locations, it is likely far better to duplicate the item rather than transport it.

Transported objects create an element of both variable state and a dynamic time region while it is in transit.

”Kits" for accomplishing an activity are valuable enough to warrant even large amounts of duplication.

### Atomic Time regions

An atomic time region is the period between beginning an activity and completing it, when the activity cannot be abandon during the region.

A section of fast moving traffic is one such example.  There is neither a way to exit at an arbitrary point, nor any inherent stability that would return things to a safe state were the driver to stop paying attention.

Another example is the time between taking an item out of a pocket to use it, and returning it, during which it can be lost.

These regions should be minimized, and things should be designed such that things can be paused or stopped at arbitrary points without consequence.


### Captive Objects


Things not meant to separate should not be able to easily, or should at least be able to stick together by themselves.

None of this "Hold these three parts in place while you Insert rod X" busisness.

Valuable items such as keys and wallets can be tethred to the inside of pockets using carabineers and grommets.   Pens can be affixed to clipboards.

Where periodic separation is required, a slipped knot, highwayman's hitch, or mechanical device should be used, but only one that requires definitive action to separate. 

A tether that can become undone simply through tension is not secure, and magnetic attachment should not be used for things exposed to arbitrary unknown force, such as portable or handheld objects.


### Watch for Reversibility

Any step that cannot easily be reversed should be avoided or given extreme caution, and an acceptable decision that can be undone may be preferable to an excellent decision that cannot.

As situations change, fixed elements add extra challenge to keep up with, but fixed elements can often be avoided through planning and engineering.

In particular, never do something in hardware that can be done digitally, unless it is safety critical and studies have shown hardware failsafes to be needed.

Don't write things in stone or make your mark that lasts forever.   Almost nothing people do is perfect, so be sure that your plans can be erased without a trace when something better comes along.

### Project to Process transitions

Projects are easy.  They have a beginning, an end, and the only goal is to finish them without seriously wrecking something.

Processes are hard.  When someone starts saying it's the journey, not the destination, suddenly you now have more than one goal, in fact, you have hundreds, because every action
must be done not only successfully, but neatly and gracefully, with a smile and good posture.


The easiest way to avoid these, is to do things in advance so that they can be done as a project, rather than live under pressure as part of a process.


### The Dreaded Chopstick

Absolutely reject any design that involves bending some part in, wedging it at an odd angle, and possibly pushing something out of the way with  chopstick.

Hands and tools should never go where eyes cannot, nor should there be any step where the act of closing a box can easily affect the (Now non-inspectable) contents 

### Eschew the Screw, careful how you connect

Screw-based connectors are often incredibly inconvenient to work with in-place, although they may seem very convenient for use in the lab.

When using terminal blocks, avoid non-detachable versions, and air hose quick connects are usually worth it.

Generally, connection points are very common failure modes.   All connectors should have a large strain relief if you want them to last, unlike a the popular slim white style USB connectors that imitate "luxury" brands.

Keychain carabineers and clips are similar danger points, as is the wrong knot in a rope.

Remember, connection can fail by coming undone, staying stuck, putting force on something else that breaks, and in sealed devices, by leaking.

Electrical contacts have all sorts of additional failure modes.

Pay attention to connection points!

### No Remapping By Swapping

A relatively common problem is something like this.  You have a box with four coloured pipes going out, and four blank ones going in.


You need to figure out which pipe to drop each colored ball in to make it come out the right pipe.

If there is already a listing of which pipes to use, but it is incorrect, people will often try to fix it by swapping incorrect ones.  When more than two are wrong, this seems to rarely work.

Instead, make a map of every input and the corresponding output (Giving them all labels that have nothing to do with what specific balls you put in!), and trace outputs back to inputs on the map.


### Look for potential problems


A lot of people will analyze a plan or situation by looking for active problems. The things that are wrong with the plan itself, that are guaranteed to cause problems.

This is important, but more equally important is to look for points where a mistake is likely, or where the consequences are large.


A wet floor is not an immediate problem until someone slips on it.  It would be easy for someone who is used to assuming perfect competence to conclude that people should see it and not slip.


Removing contributing factors is often easier then directly avoiding problems for several reasons.

One is that you cannot always be sure of the future, or what additional circumstances will complicate your plan to avoid the mistake.

Another is that, like the wet floor, "Being careful" must often be done continually, in this case each and every time, whereas removing the contributing factor often only needs to be done one time(as in mopping the water), and will persistently make things safer until something causes the factor to return.

### Beware things that make *using* them the same as *engineering* them

In the Linux world there's a lot of talk about modularity, but
they usually leave final integration to the user.  A typical UNIX style program
isn't a program at all, it's a building block to make your own program.

This can be a major time sink, and it's important to recognize the value
of integration, and purpose built devices.

A multimeter *can* be used as a cable tester, but only in a very inconvenient
way.

A proper module system is seamless, and trivial to reconfigure, but this is often hard to
achieve.  Beware of building toolkits to build another tool to do something,
and mislabeling them as directly usable tools.

### Watch out for tasks involving listing or counting scattered elements

Tasks like "Count how many cars are in that parking lot" are very difficult because
there is no obvious ordering, and no way to know if you have already counted any particular item.

If you have to do something like this, and can't find any kind of row/column based system, 
one should not trust their memory. If all can fit in a single photograph, they can be counted and
digitally marked, or, for things like outlets in a house, they can be physically marked with tape.

Especially watch out for tasks involving listing things that do not yet exist, like "What will we need for the party?"

For that, only a complete dry run test, or detailed plan down to the last paper plate is likely to help you function
any better than your own talent and competence would.

When making such a plan, look at every step and ensure that you have not lumped any separate steps together and left places where
mistakes can hide. An overview, program of events, or schedule is not a plan.

Pouring wine involves opening it, which may involve a corkscrew, and actually doing the pouring, which probably involves cups.

And more than any of this, avoid any use whatsoever of undocumented lists of multiple items of any kind.  

If you go to the store for five separate things, assume that one will, as a deterministic fact, be forgotten unless the entire list
is written down.  If you are confident you remember everything and don't need to check the list, that is exactly when you need to check it.


### Compatible standards

Many things are made better by being all the same.  Unfortunately, these things are made worse when they require things to be *all* the same.

Nobody would be happy if they had to upgrade every device in the house when a new WiFi hotspot comes out.   Get the best when buying new, but leave room in plans for old and perfectly good things.

Don't write code that doesn't run on old computers.

And more than that, don't create disruption to existing processes.  Don't 
fence off an area for a cable if a wireless link will do.  Don't delsy people's lives because you insist they first learn some new system to proceed.

Don't use updates that run automatically.  Tech should stay out of the way, not add additional things people have to keep up with.

Some things are obsolete and should be upgraded immediately, but usually only the user knows which things those are.

### Minimize Unique parts

It's bad enough to use dozens of parts when a few lines
of code would do.   What's worse is to have dozens of
one-of-a-kind, custom, handmade, imported, or otherwise nonstandard parts.


Ever tried putting together a tent with four different lengths of poles
and several different kinds of clips?

Not only is this kind of design a hassle to build, it's expensive, as the 
benefits of mass production are partly cancelled out, it leads to obsolescence
when replacements are no longer available, and often, those parts are not
well tested, as they are generally new and not made by the million.


Especially avoid slightly modified off the sheet parts if possible, although it may still be better
than a scratch build.

In that case, you never know if the original manufacturer will change the internals
of the design so that it no longer works, on top of the extra effort and unpredictably of
customizing something.

This also goes for unique pieces of software.  If you don't have time
to do it better than the people who did it before, just use theirs.

### It's hard to automate things you can't describe

Automation is great, but when usability or aesthetics matter, the computer isn't always going to "get it".

To automate something, you need to be able to fully describe what you want, or just let machine learning guess.

Fully describing what you want is often equivalent to doing something by hand, or else is a limited version that isn't actually what anyone wants.

Computers can fnd the right decoder for a file format, they can reconnect when the network goes down, but designing a bookshelf requires
a real understanding of how it will be used.   It is important to see what problems are "Hard", and can be fully described in a page or two, and what problems are "soft", meaning we don't really know the algorithm we use to do them.

In addition, aesthetics will always depend on context and one should not expect it to be ignored.

Many people will not appreciate something generated entirely by machine.

Many things are only valuable because of the origin story.  In many
cases the origin has a dark side, and one can argue that the origin, the aesthetic,
and the symbolism are all representative of something evil that should not be desired.

Nonetheless, one cannot expect something entirely artificial to be appreciated unless
it has some sort of context.


### Beware the Wear
Many devices use flash memory. Many automatically save whatever you change.  

Few take any steps to avoid wearing out the disk in a few years,
because a few years is thought to be an acceptable lifetime for a device.  

Don't do that. It's not acceptable!  Actions outside the user's control especially
should not contribute to device wear.  Things should not just be expected to wear down
over time.

More generally, avoid coupling *any* frequently-done action, (like changing a color), to an automatic action that causes wear(like saving to flash)


### Replacability!

Things that don't last, should be replacable. Don't let a design leave the drawing
board if it becomes disposable because of one part. Beyond that, things that wear should
be common and available anywhere, like 0.7mm pencil leads, not propietary to one manufacturer, or
even handmade and totally unique.


### Never assume that problems will be correctly reported

People do not consistently report issues, even when it is 
their responsibility to do so.

The issue may make themself or a friend look bad.  It
may also make an enemy look bad, who may retaliate.

Perhaps they forgot, or even wilfully sabotaged the situation in question
themselves.  Perhaps they think you don't want to be bothered.  Maybe they
have already reported several issues and think you're getting tired of them.

Whatever the case may be, people will often not tell you things
you need to know, unless you specificaly ask, and even then, they may not know.


### People are bad at monitoring things

Never assume that a person is capable of monitoring an automated process,
or someone else's work, just because they have done this work themselves.

It is a well known phenomena that people switching to the role of
monitor can easily become complacent, and sometimes the results
can be worse than before the automation or extra help.

### Take the job of monitoring seriously

On a related note, When you are there to watch for trouble, no matter how rare the trouble may be, 
you must still take your job seriously.

If you slack off because you don't expect trouble,
you are not acting with integrity.


### Regression to prior learning

If a potentially dangerous action is similar to a common action
that people will have learned before, assume that the dangerous action *will* be mistakenly
performed, and that this will most likely occur during a time of stress when the situation is
already primed for a disaster.

### Beware indirect proxies of quality

Simple. German Engineered.  Made in America. All
metal construction. Handmade. Natural.

None of these are a crystal ball
to tell you how a product will perform, look, or whether it will last.

What they tell you is how well they conform to some tradition that
seems, to someone, to be associated with quality.  There may be
reasons for this in some cases, but over time, these vauge indicators
become goals in and of themselves, and eventually they can become philosophical
axioms, where the value of product itself is irrelevant, and the choice
is made for idealistic reasons.

When dealing with people, such as looking for someone 
to do a job, words like Certified. Experienced. Intelligent, Honest,
etc, come into play.   In this case, one presumably *does* want a properly trained
employee, and honesty is always valued.

Someone with a decade of experience doing consistently terrible work, however, is clearly no better
than someone with only a year of experience.

### Slow is smooth, smooth is fast

While machines can place multiple parts per second
with sub millimeter accuracy, you probably cannot.

If you try to, you will likely break something. And even if you don't, someone
else probably will while trying to keep up.  Avoid this.

### Get the lead out

There are few luxuries that can compare to *not* having to carry 
a bunch of heavy crap.  Be very careful about the weight of the things you buy, if
you will be carrying them even a short while, and ruthlessly prune or upgrade anything in
your bag that weighs you donw.  If it costs money I'm sure
there are meals at restaurants you can skip, because not much tastes as
good as not hauling crap around.

Similarly, when designing portable things, aim for the smallest weight
and minimum number of items.

And if you must carry something, try to put it on a rolling cart. You will probably
feel much better at the end of the day.

### Literally get the lead out

I'm sure you know about lead paint and gas, but did you know it could be in your
keys? The prongs and plastic of your extension cord(It is or was used to stabilize PVC)?

Brass often uses it to make machining easier. Old crystal glass has it. Maybe
new crystal glass too. It has all kinds of uses, so don't
assume any random thing is good safe.

### Manufactured Hurries and artificial deadlines

These are terrible mental devices that have been used for everything from
landing someone in the hospital, to making unwanted sexual advances.

The way it works is pretty simple.   Someone has a bad idea, which they
want to pursue for irrational reasons.  Perhaps trying the hardest ski route with no experience.

If you resist or hesitate, one tactic they almost instinctively seem to employ
is a sense of urgency.

They will speed up their words and movements, speaking in short, controlled bursts
as if using an assault weapon of verbal Diarrhea.

Traditionally, one may associate talking too fast with weakness
or being on the defensive. However, someone using this tactic likely
is already filled with confidence. They have no complicated reasoning
to explain, and thus the short bursts of words seem enthusiastic, not defensive.

And on top of it, this tactic often happens on one-on-one situations.


The trouble occurs when you respond.  If you take your time to explain something,
they may interrupt you, or look as though they are threatening to.

If you match their pace, you will probably sound like a maniac and stumble
over your own sentences, because you quite likely need more words to explain
your position than "It will be awesome bro!".

On top of this, your reasons may well involve a mistrust you don't feel comfortable expressing.

They may be saying something you know to be untrue, like "It's perfectly safe",
and you may think you are not in a position to argue.

The added self censorship makes it even harder to speak at their pace.


They have given themselves the home field advantage, an insane
conversational style to match an insane idea.



On top of it all, they may physically move towards their part of whatever they are planning,,
threatening to leave you behind, or implement the bad plan without your agreement at all.

In these cases, there may be no other answer aside from short controlled bursts of your
own, such as "No way!", possibly with your expletives of choice.

The strategy on their part relies on you thinking that you need a reason to refuse,
and that you must make a decision immediately.

As your reason may not be explainable in a matter of seconds, you may feel that your reason
is not valid or good enough.   However, if they don't need a reason to *do* whatever it is,
than surely you don't need a reason to *not do* whatever it is.

The tactic may also rely on an implication that overthinking things is "weak" or otherwise bad.
I believe this is best ignored entirely, to the absolute best of your ability, on account of the vast amount problems one can find by
trying too hard to prove themselves.

Facebook, incidentally, is thought to use this via endless scrolling, 
forcing an immediate interaction, or else the risk of losing that content forever
to the miles long news feed.

### Think "Never again" not "Life Happens"

For some people, mistakes are a natural part of life,
to be embraced as a chance to learn about yourself and
your capability under pressure.

When making a plan to avoid mistakes, these people may attempt
to guilt trip you.  They may not understand your need for such a plan.

They may tell you to just carry on but "Be more careful" next time,
with no explanation for how that works, or how you're
supposed to not make unrelated mistakes while spending all this
extra time "being careful" of the original mistake you are trying not
to repeat.

Many problems are highly preventable, and it is only
a *lack of desire to prevent them* that stops us, or
a belief that a need for constant vigilance against them
is "just how life is", and that it's "not worth it" to
make the changes needed to stop it.

If a mistake jappens once, it can happen again, to the same
person, or to someone else entirely, unless something is done
differently.

"Being more careful" isn't really doing something different
unless you have a concrete plan.  Will you work slower? Will
you double and triple check things in different ways? If not,
then what stops "Being careful" from being empty words?

Being careful is often a loaded phrase, implying that
you were not being careful at all when the mistake was made.

We don't have to accept this kind of thinking.  We don't have to constantly
live just a little outside our capabilities while things fall apart around us.

By making real, actionable plans, we can prevent many mistakes both big and
small.
